# Smart_Attendance_System_Pro
This repository contains the codebase for a Smart Attendance System, which utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of taking attendance.
# Overview
Traditional methods of taking attendance can be time-consuming and inefficient. This Smart Attendance System aims to streamline the attendance process by leveraging facial recognition algorithms to identify and mark the presence of individuals automatically.

# Technology Used
<ul>
   <li> Python: Core programming language for backend processing.</li>
   <li> OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks, including face detection.</li>
   <li> DLib: Toolkit for creating machine learning algorithms.</li>
   <li> SQLite: Database for storing attendance records.</li>
   <li> Flask: Micro web framework for building the user interface.</li>
   <li> HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for the user interface.</li>
</ul>
