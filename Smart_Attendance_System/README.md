# Smart_Attendance_System_Pro
This repository contains the codebase for a Smart Attendance System, which utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of taking attendance.
# Overview
Traditional methods of taking attendance can be time-consuming and inefficient. This Smart Attendance System aims to streamline the attendance process by leveraging facial recognition algorithms to identify and mark the presence of individuals automatically.

# Technology Used
<ul>
   <li> Python: Core programming language for backend processing.</li>
   <li> OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks, including face detection.</li>
   <li> DLib: Toolkit for creating machine learning algorithms.</li>
   <li> SQLite: Database for storing attendance records.</li>
   <li> Flask: Micro web framework for building the user interface.</li>
   <li> HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for the user interface.</li>
</ul>

# Installation
<ol>
    <li>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-attendance-system.git (Clone the repository) </li>
    <li>pip install -r requirements.txt (Install dependencies)</li>
    <li>python manage.py runserver (Run the application) </li>
</ol>

# Uses
<ol>
    <li>Launch the application by running "python manage.py runserver"</li>
    <li>Navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" in your web browser.</li>
    <li>Register faces of individuals (students/employees) into the system.</li>
    <li>Use the system to mark attendance automatically during sessions.</li>
</ol>
